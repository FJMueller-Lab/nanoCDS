# nanoCDS [![build status][1]][2] [![codecov][3]][4]
<!--
    Above uses reference-style links with numbers.
    See also https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links.

    For example, `[![build status][1]][2]` evaluates to the following:
        `[link_text][2]`
        `[2]` is a reference to a link, i.e. `[link_text](https://...)`

        `[link_text]` = `[![build status][1]]`
        `[1]` is once again a reference to a link - this time an image, i.e. `[![build status](https://...)]
        `![build status]` is the text that should be displayed if the linked resource (`[1]`) is not available

    `[![build status][1]][2]` hence means:
    Show the picture linked under `[1]`. In case it cannot be displayed, show the text "build status" instead.
    The picture, or alternative text, should link to `[2]`.

nanoCDS is a small tool for chronologically downsampling fastq files generated from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (minion, promethion, etc...).
Users can downsample their sequencing data to reads generated within a window of time.
The downsampled data is meant to better simulate lower coverage than random sampling of reads especially for real-time applications.

Usage:
```bash
nanoCDS -m 60 test_ont.fastq # Get all reads generated within the first hour of sequencing
```

nanoCDS is based off the SeqAn3 app-template and makes heavy use of this library.
